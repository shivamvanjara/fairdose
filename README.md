# FairDose 💊

FairDose is a web application that helps users compare medicine prices by
composition (salt) and identify affordable alternatives, including
government generic medicines (Jan Aushadhi).

It also supports scanning handwritten prescriptions using OCR to
automatically detect medicines and search for cheaper options.
